          Hydraulic pressure testing is a critical safety procedure performed on
          fire extinguishers and other pressurized fire safety equipment to
          ensure they can withstand the operating pressures they may encounter
          during use. This testing involves filling the extinguisher with water
          and applying pressure significantly higher than its normal operating
          pressure to check for leaks, structural integrity, and overall
          durability. Hydraulic pressure testing is required periodically to
          comply with safety regulations and standards, ensuring that fire
          extinguishers are safe and reliable.

          Testing Procedure
        </div>
        <p class="services-redirect-information-para">
          The testing procedure begins with the extinguisher being emptied and
          cleaned. It is then filled with water and connected to a hydraulic
          testing machine. Pressure is gradually increased to a specified level,
          usually 1.5 times the operating pressure, and held for a predetermined
          period. The extinguisher is inspected for any signs of leaks, bulging,
          or deformation. If the extinguisher passes the test, it is emptied,
          dried, reassembled, and marked with a new test date. If it fails, it
          is removed from service and replaced.
